Firenote : for super fast notes and snippets. Hassle-free, login-free, super simple note taking saved in browser localstorage. 

The original concept was for a lightweight bookmarklet launched and locally run emergency note taking device for emergency saving of info just prior to a crash or power outage, or other unwelcome moment that threatens active work. Memory overload? processor maxed out? Before the failure a quick launch and pasting of your work into firenote can often save you from banging your head against the desk when you realize your office editing program, gmail, or even gedit open docs are not current or non-existent on reboot. localstorage survives and persists when nearly everything else is unrecoverable. 

great as a desktop widget in most OS's, tested with Ubuntu : running Cairo Dock and Unity/Gnome

Concept designed and put to the test in Mexico in a house with poor wiring while cranking out massive resource rich projects on an underpowered system. 

sample versions include default localstorage saving, Original Fiery Font style (wo/save), WebSQL save aka FireNoteSQL, LiveNote, and more! 

made with frustration used often
